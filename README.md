# Homebrew/head-only (deprecated)
These formulae were unversioned (they had no stable release) so were only available as the latest version from e.g. a version control system.

This tap was deprecated because unversioned formulae provide a terrible UX. All
formulae have been migrated to [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) or [the boneyard](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-boneyard).
